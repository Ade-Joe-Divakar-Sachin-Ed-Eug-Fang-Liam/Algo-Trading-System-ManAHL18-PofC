# Algo-Trading-System-ManAHL18-PofC

A prototype algo trading platform developed for the Man AHL open source hackathon. This code constitutes a proof of concept, consisting of:
-Data collection (time series and macro-data)
-Data cleaning
-Feature extraction
-Ensemble classifier ML system for price direction prediction
-Trading strategy backtesting component

Next steps include integrating the seperate components together into an initial build to demonstrate proof of concept functionality.
