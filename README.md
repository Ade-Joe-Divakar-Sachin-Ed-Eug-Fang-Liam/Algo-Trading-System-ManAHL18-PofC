# Algo-Trading-System-ManAHL18-PofC

A prototype algo trading platform developed for the Man AHL open source hackathon. This code constitutes a proof of concept, consisting of: 

-Data collection (time series and macro-data) 

-Data cleaning 

-Feature extraction 

-Ensemble classifier ML system for price direction prediction 

-Trading strategy backtesting component 


Next steps include integrating the seperate components together into an initial build to demonstrate proof of concept functionality.
